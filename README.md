Gridfinity Models
=================

This repo contains a selection of Gridfinity models that I have created for
personal use. Most of them will likely be sub-optimal, but fit the use-case I
wanted them for well enough.

BasicGridfinityBox
------------------

Parametric FreeCAD model of a Gridfinity box. Does not (currently) on it's own
support creating containers, but is rather intended to be a base from which to
subtract another model to create a container.

ChipWhisperer
-------------

Set of models to hold various parts of the ChipWhisperer Husky kit. Was designed
to be used with ![this storage box](https://www.printables.com/model/543553-gridfinity-storage-box-by-pred-now-parametric),
but can be used stand-alone as well.
